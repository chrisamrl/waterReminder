# Water Reminder

## Description
People tend to forget to drink water when they're using their laptop. This project is a simple
chrome extension that reminds you to drink water every 30 minutes. To turn on this alarm, simply press "On", and it will
automatically remind you to drink water. Also, if you click on the notification, it will redirect you to a short youtube video to 
help you exercise.
